# ssh-agent
# Start the ssh-agent in the background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Depending on your environment, you may need to use a different command. For example, you may need to use root access
# by running sudo -s -H before starting the ssh-agent, or you may need to use exec ssh-agent bash or exec ssh-agent
# zsh to run the ssh-agent.
